## Features Left to Implement

1. On home page I would prefer it to be moving pictures of kids, like giffs or shorter movies. Maybe an audio of some baby laughter.

2. There should be pictures or videos to all cards with shown content on how to do the specific tip. For example on tips and tricks there is one card telling you to button the body over babies shoulder to make them stay still. It would be more informative with a video showing the tip. Or on the card that mentions white noises it could be a playlist to use.

3. On the banner image for desktop the train could be pulling the cover text on screen instead of having it pop when the train have passed.

## Testing

1. My page with it's animations and cards appear good on desktop (1201px and up) and also on smaller screens (1200px and below). 

2. Page works good on chrome, firefox, iphone and android. On explorer the pictures in the index file has another width and also the train isn't appearing.

3. All links are tested in each try of diffrent browsers and all opens in a new window.
